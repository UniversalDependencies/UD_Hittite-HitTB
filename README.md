# Summary

UD_Hittite-HitTB is a small Universal Dependencies treebank for Hittite, containing original sentences from Hoffner and Melchert's tutorial to A Grammar of the Hittite Language.


# Introduction

This Hittite treebank contains 136 sentences, 1309 words, and 970 (whitespace-separated) tokens. It contains a variety of sentences spanning each of the major periods in Hittite linguistic history: Old Hittite, Middle Hittite, and New Hittite. These are included in one treebank due to the existence of copies that span multiple different eras.


# Acknowledgments

We would like to extend our gratitude to David Wright, Professor of Bible and Ancient Near East at
Brandeis University, for offering his excellent course on Hittite in Spring 2020.
